Top Spots of San Diego (using Angular)

This is the same as the last project, but using Angular. To sum up- it retrieves external JSON data and displays it in a table of popular hot spots in San Diego and also links some of the data to a Google Map location.

The technologies used were:

- HTML
- CSS
    + Pure CSS Framework
- Javascript
    + Angular
- Bower (to import Pure and Angular)
- Node-static (to run it locally without CORS issues)
